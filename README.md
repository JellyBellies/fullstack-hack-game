# fullstack-hack-game
Fullstack conf 2016 - Game

During the full stack conference at Skillsmatter Codenode, I was putting together this game as a little hack during the lunches (the intention was to submit it to a pusher competition but 1. it's not that good, and 2. pusher is not peer to peer, which sucks as I didn't want to set up a server, and 3. it's not even a game...).

The aim of the "game" is to click the grey circle. My intention was to confuse players by having them misclick circles as a result of an optical illusion (you may recognise it - the overlaid grid and white circles should flash black/grey in the corner of your eye).

In reality, it didn't trick me into clicking the wrong circle (even trying to add a pulsing scale and opacity with CSS animations didn't trick me). The code was tested in JSFiddle (hence the lack of build boilerplate) and can be checked here https://jsfiddle.net/tgjk2cnu/8/
